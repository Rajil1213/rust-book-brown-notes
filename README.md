# rust-book-brown-notes

This repo contains my notes to the [interactive Rust Book fork](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu)
from Brown University, including:

* Almost all code samples presented in the book (with my own tweaks where relevant).
* Both projects.
* Quizzes and their solutions.

This repo contains more of an abridged version of the original book than just notes in that it
retains most of the content of the book but without the surrounding "fluff", so that I (and perhaps,
even you) can get at information more quickly.

The notes are also available as a static Notion site [here](https://whitenoise1213.notion.site/7583edc1f8bb4af39a65383b3c698136?v=aa858d024f3142b8a62cd91241b3f784&pvs=4).
